# Expression Tree

## About

### This is a simple web application to visualize binary expression trees using JavaScript, CSS and HTML

## Client

### The client was developed on HTML, CSS and JavaScript using [Treant.js](http://fperucic.github.io/treant-js/)

## Server

### The server was developed on Java using [Apache Tomcat 9.0.8](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi) and [Jersey RESTful services](https://jersey.github.io/). Some templates were used like a [Java REST API](https://www.mkyong.com/webservices/jax-rs/json-example-with-jersey-jackson/) (other templates are internally documented). Currently, the app works in Google Chrome using the [CORS extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi) and disabling every advertisement blocker
